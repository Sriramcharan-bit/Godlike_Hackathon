## 🚀 Overview

**Questify Learning** is a gamified learning platform that transforms any curriculum into a **quest-based adventure**.  
Instead of “Chapter 1 → Chapter 2 → Test,” learners progress through an interactive **learning map** where each **node** is a small, active challenge, quiz, or coding task.

It’s learning — but designed like a game.  
Earn XP, unlock levels, and learn by doing.

## 🎯 Problem

- Traditional learning feels monotonous and passive.  
- Students lose motivation and see assessments as punishment.  
- There’s no *sense of progress* or *instant feedback*.  

---

## 💡 Solution

**Questify Learning** makes education feel like an **adventure game**:
- Each topic becomes a **quest map**.
- Each node is a **micro learning experience** — a video, quiz, or coding challenge.
- Learners earn XP and unlock levels by completing quests.
- Instead of “grades,” you just *try again* until you win.

## 🧠 MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

Our hackathon prototype focuses on **“Python For Loops”** as a sample quest.

### 🗺️ Learning Path Nodes:
1. **🎬 Video Quest** — Watch an animated intro to Python loops.  
2. **🧩 Quiz Quest** — Test your understanding of loop concepts.  
3. **💻 Code Quest** — Fix and run a Python `for` loop.  
4. **🐞 Debug Quest** — Find and fix a bug in a loop.  
5. **⚙️ Mini Project** — Write a small code snippet to sum a list.  

Each quest adds XP and visually unlocks the next stage on the map.
